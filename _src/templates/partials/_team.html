            <h3 class="subtitle">Weakness</h3>
            <p class="texteam"> We are junior developers in process, assimilating lots of information in a
                    short period of time. Despite the long hours of practice and personal commitment, we are aware
                    of this just being the beginning and that we still have many hours to invest in our training
                    and therefore, much to learn.
